Typeahead-Multiple
==================

Support for autocompleting multiple values in Bootstrap Typeahead

Details
-------
This library allows for typeahead similar to Typeahead.js or Bootstrap 2's typeahead. Typeahead-Multiple, however, allows for autocompletion of more than one value inside a single textbox. So when you finish typing or autocompleting a word, you can immediately begin typing a second word after the first and suggestions will be displayed for it.

Usage
-----

This library is meant for usage with Bootstrap 2's typeahead. It can also be used with similarly-structured systems such as [Bootstrap-3-Typeahead] [1].
